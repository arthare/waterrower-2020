  "description": "A quick NodeJS app to turn my WaterRower into a cycling powermeter so I can play TourJs (btweb2) with it (or, you know, Zwift/TrainerRoad/Rouvy/Sufferfest/etc).  Inspired by waterrower-ble, but I got to write way less code than him thanks to the guys that wrote the `waterrower` and `bleno` since he made his library in 2015.",
